# Hi, I'm RikuAyanami 👋

**Software Engineer • Automation Builder • Creator**

Welcome to my GitHub. I build high-efficiency tools, experiment with system-level automation, and create content explaining programming concepts and workflow optimization.  
My focus is practicality: tools that actually solve problems — fast, lightweight, and reliable.
